### Description: 

#### Task 1 - Backend, REST

Create a new Maven project with Spring Boot. 
In this task, you will create one or more endpoints for the calculator. 
The endpoint(s) should receive a calculation and return an answer in the form of JSON. 
All requests should be logged in the backend console, and remember to use a layered architecture.

##### Requirements for approval:

  - Layered architecture (controller, model, service, and possibly other components)

#### Task 2 - Frontend
Make changes to the frontend of the calculator application. 
Calculations should now be sent to the REST API, and the response/result of the calculation should be displayed.

##### Requirements for approval:
  - The web application sends a request to an endpoint in the REST API, and the result is displayed to the user.
